# Assist
I started this thing as a job runner sort of program I want running on my older laptop I run linux on at home. The notion of it is that I want to write code that I can run periodically or schedule for a one-off, and just not have to think about it. I know Cron jobs and scheduling libraries exist, but creating this myself is also an exercise in understanding how to design a system that wants to work this way, and also maybe possibly letting it interact with itself.

Anyway. It's written in Python 3.8. The first thing I wanted to create was a mail-to-kindle type of thing that could run on a daily basis to sync books to my Kindle without me having to manually run the whole process.
